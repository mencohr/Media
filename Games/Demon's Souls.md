A child-looking NPC on the top floor of the Nexus.

#### About

She moves around the bottom floor of the Nexus a lot. 

Met me in the Nexus after I kill the Phalanx King in Gates of Bolateria. Probably the one who resurrected me. Said the Monumental was waiting and would explain the Nexus to me. 

The Old Monumental said she holds back the Old One and has become a demon herself to do so. 

#### Services

### Rude Guy 

Rude guy in the Nexus asked me if I came to end the demons or join them. Hunting for demons? Try one of the Archstones. Said I'm welcome in the Nexus as long as I keep slashing up demons. Called me just another prisoner of the Nexus. 

After killing the Phalanx King: Surprised I'm alive. Tells me how to level up but warns me not to "decay into a foul beast."

After meeting the Monumental, he said he lost his nerve and decided to remain and stop trying. Is in soul form. 

He seems to go through bouts of amnesia, is surprised I can see him, and is confused about whether he's in his corporeal flesh. 

He accuses me of falling for "their" trap. With more demons slain, I become a monster. 

He disappeared after I died after the Iron Knight fight. Left behind the Storied Warrior Soul.

Possibly the lordling Dregling referred to? I rescued him from some enemies, and he gave me a brass telescope.

He said he had to leave and go elsewhere, and that no matter how far he traveled, no sane were left.

Refuses to believe Father (his biological father? Is it Allant?) wished for this.

# Lore

On the first day, man had souls and clarity. On the second day, the land was poisoned by a soul-devouring demon. A fog swept across the land, and Boletaria was cut off from the outside world. Those who went out never returned, though Vallarfax of the Twin Fangs broke free of the fog and told the outside world about Boletaria. 

The fog brought demons that hunt men and claim their souls, driving them mad. Somehow, Allant awakened the Old One, a beast below the Nexus, from slumber. Humanity faces slow extinction, but Boletaria has a final hope in the player character. Whether they will be a savior or a slave to the demons depends on gameplay. 

King Allant the 12th channeled the power of souls (?) for prosperity in Boletaria. 

Vallarfax said that demon souls are enticing(?), and demons become stronger from human souls. 

Warriors have went to the fissure (where is it?). The player has been guided to the fissure to lull the Old One back to slumber. 

These names were mentioned with no context. 

* Biorr of Twin Fangs
* Yurt Silent Chief
* Saint Urbain
* Scirvir the Wnaderer
* Saint Astaea with knight Gairl Vinland
* Sage Freke the Visionary

Five Archstones guide one beyond the Nexus to outer lands. The Nexus holds holds together the northern land of Boletaria 

Monumentals preserve fabric of reality, they claim. 

Tale: They once faced a scourge of demons. In the distant past, the world was united due to the soul arts. A peaceful time. Lust for power caused the Old One to awaken. Fog swept across land, and the world faced extinction. Were able to lull Old One back to sleep, only after countless died. Most of the world was still lost. 

To mend the fabric, six leaders received six Archstones. 

* One to king of small, industrious land 
* One to king of underground - Digger King
* One to wise queen of Ivory Tower
* One to chieftain of lost, ill souls 
* One to shaman of shadowmen
* One to great giants of Northern Lands 

Archstones placed in fringelands. Old One contained below Nexus, soul arts stopped. 

Monumentals: half-living sentinels of fabric of reality. 

Other Monumentals have died and only one remains at the Nexus. 

Blonde unnamed woman: Said Allant roused the Old One, from short-sighted humanity, after the Monumentals spread the Archstones and beat the Old One. Said she lived below Bolateria Castle. If she hadn't had a soul shard (?) of her grandfather, she may not have survived. Said Allant left on strange business, demons came back in tow. 

Freke says these three came to become demons but didn't fully cease to be demons: 

King Allant of Bolateria 

Astraea of Valley of Defilement 

Golden Usurper of Latria

Someone said Demons put souls to work

# NG+

What if Stockpile Thomas never receives the Jade Ornament?  

Is there a way to save the Rude Guy? 

Can I get miracles earlier? 

Missed a lot on first playthrough. Did NG+ until right before Phalanx boss. I think Ostravia is still alive and won't die this time. Unlocked gate on lefthand side. But messed up World Tendency, and don't know if I can do Pure White for this one. Will try to kill 3 bosses while in Body form without dying, then do full black after Pure White tasks are achieved.
