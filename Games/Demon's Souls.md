### One of the Monumentals

#### About 

Monumentals preserve fabric of reality, they claim. 

Tale: They once faced a scourge of demons. In the distant past, the world was united due to the soul arts. A peaceful time. Lust for power caused the Old One to awaken. Fog swept across land, and the world faced extinction. Were able to lull Old One back to sleep, only after countless died. Most of the world was still lost. 

To mend the fabric, six leaders received six Archstones. 

* One to king of small, industrious land 
* One to king of underground - Digger King
* One to wise queen of Ivory Tower
* One to chieftain of lost, ill souls 
* One to shaman of shadowmen
* One to great giants of Northern Lands 

Archstones placed in fringelands. Old One contained below Nexus, soul arts stopped. 

Monumentals: half-living sentinels of fabric of reality. 

Other Monumentals have died and only one remains at the Nexus. 

Said Allant roused the Old One, from short-sighted humanity, after the Monumentals spread the Archstones and beat the Old One. 

#### Decisions

Accepted "yes" when asked if I'd take the mission. 

### Candle Maiden

#### About

Met me in the Nexus after I kill the Phalanx King in Gates of Bolateria. Probably the one who resurrected me. 

Said the Monumental was waiting and would explain the Nexus to me. 

### Rude Guy 

Rude guy in the Nexus asked me if I came to end the demons or join them. Hunting for demons? Try one of the Archstones. Said I'm welcome in the Nexus as long as I keep slashing up demons. Called me just another prisoner of the Nexus. 

After killing the Phalanx King: Surprised I'm alive. Tells me how to level up but warns me not to "decay into a foul beast."

After meeting the Monumental, he said he lost his nerve and decided to remain and stop trying. Is in soul form. 

He seems to go through bouts of amnesia, is surprised I can see him, and is confused about whether he's in his corporeal flesh. 

He accuses me of falling for "their" trap. With more demons slain, I become a monster. 

He disappeared after I died after the Iron Knight fight. Left behind the Storied Warrior Soul. 

### Stockpile Thomas

#### About

He offers storage service.

He lost his wife and daughter to demons when the "scourge" came and said he abandoned them like a coward. Now, he wants to help competent fighters in the Nexus. 

After Armor Spider: Discusses he owes a lot to the honorable defenders of the Nexus. 

#### Quest

#### Decisions

* I gave him the Jade Hair Ornament found in the Gates of Boletaria, and he said it was his dead daughter's.

### Unnamed Blonde Woman

#### About 

She asks if God has abandoned us for something we haven't done for Allant? Didn't catch the detail. 

Said she lived below Bolateria Castle. If she hadn't had a soul shard (?) of her grandfather, she may not have survived. 

Said Allant left on strange business, demons came back in tow. 

After defeating the Armor Spider, said her grandfather went to Stonefang, found a miracle stone-shard he gave to her.

#### Notes

He doesn't say anything different after Ostrava dies. 

Disappears after Phalanx battle and meets me again on dragon double bridge. 

### Ostrava of Boletaria

#### About

Possibly the lordling Dregling referred to? I rescued him from some enemies, and he gave me a brass telescope.

He said he had to leave and go elsewhere, and that no matter how far he traveled, no sane were left.

<u>If the knight in the Nexus is also Ostrava:</u>

Said before the blight, everyone was steadfast and compassionate. Said he's studied southern cultures and loves Boletaria. 

Refuses to believe Father (his biological father? Is it Allant?) wished for this. 

#### Quest

* Will possibly see him elsewhere. 

#### Notes

He seems to keep wandering around where I rescued him in Bolateria, fighting random enemies. 

He died and dropped the Mausoleum Key. The knight in the Nexus that may have been him is no longer there.

# Lore

On the first day, man had souls and clarity. On the second day, the land was poisoned by a soul-devouring demon. A fog swept across the land, and Boletaria was cut off from the outside world. Those who went out never returned, though Vallarfax of the Twin Fangs broke free of the fog and told the outside world about Boletaria. 

The fog brought demons that hunt men and claim their souls, driving them mad. Somehow, Allant awakened the Old One, a beast below the Nexus, from slumber. Humanity faces slow extinction, but Boletaria has a final hope in the player character. Whether they will be a savior or a slave to the demons depends on gameplay. 

King Allant the 12th channeled the power of souls (?) for prosperity in Boletaria. 

Vallarfax said that demon souls are enticing(?), and demons become stronger from human souls. 

Warriors have went to the fissure (where is it?). The player has been guided to the fissure to lull the Old One back to slumber. 

These names were mentioned with no context. 

* Biorr of Twin Fangs
* Yurt Silent Chief
* Saint Urbain
* Scirvir the Wnaderer
* Saint Astaea with knight Gairl Vinland
* Sage Freke the Visionary

Five Archstones guide one beyond the Nexus to outer lands. The Nexus holds holds together the northern land of Boletaria

What if Stockpile Thomas never receives the Jade Ornament?  

Is there a way to save the Rude Guy?
